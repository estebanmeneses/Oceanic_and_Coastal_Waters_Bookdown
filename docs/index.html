<p>Sometimes a quadratically weighted averaged value is used to define the rootmean-square wave height Hrms:</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:1">\[\begin{equation}
  H_{rms} = (\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N})^{1/2}
\tag{1.1}  
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>Such a measure of wave heights may be relevant for energy-related projects because the wave energy is proportional to the square of the wave height.</p>
<p>One of the concepts of the significant wave height is (Hs) the mean of the highest one-third of waves in the wave record<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:2">\[\begin{equation}
Hs = H_{1/3} = \frac{1}{N/3} \sum_{j=1}^{N/3} H_j
\tag{1.2}  
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>When j is the rank number of wave height (i.e., j=1 is the first highest wave, j=2 is the second highest and so on).</p>
<p>Sometimes it is consider the mean of the highest one-tenth:</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:3">\[\begin{equation}
H_{1/10} = \frac{1}{N/10} \sum_{j=1}^{N/10} H_j

<p>It is equally natural to define the period T of a wave as the time interval between the start and the end of the wave (see Fig. <a href="index.html#fig:wave">1.1</a>).</p>
<p>In analogy with the significant wave height, the significant wave period Ts is defined as the mean period of the highest one-third of waves, T1/3.</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:4">\[\begin{equation}
T_{1/3} = \frac{1}{N/3} \sum_{j=1}^{N/3} T_{0,j}

<p>where, again, j is not the sequence number but the rank number of the wave, based on wave height (it is the same j as in the definition of the significant wave height, Eq. <a href="index.html#eq:4">(1.4)</a>).</p>

<p>The agreement between the visually estimated significant wave height (Hv) and the measured significant wave height (H1/3) is reasonable.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> <strong>Wave Spectrum</strong><a href="index.html#wave-spectrum" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The aim of describing ocean waves with a spectrum is not so much to describe in detail one observation of the sea surface (i.e., one time record), but rather to describe the sea surface as a stochastic process, i.e., to characterise all possible observations (time records).</p>
<p>Here, we base this treatment on the random-phase/amplitude model, which leads to the wave spectrum, which is the most important form in which ocean waves are described.</p>
<p>To distinguish the essence from these additional aspects, consider first a wave record, i.e., the surface elevation η(t) at one location as a function of time, with duration D, obtained at sea with a wave buoy or a wave pole (see Fig. <a href="index.html#fig:elevation">1.3</a>).</p>
<p>We can exactly reproduce that record as the sum of a large number of harmonic wave components (a Fourier series):</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:5">\[\begin{equation}
\eta(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_{i}cos(2 \pi f_{i} t + \alpha_{i})
\tag{1.5}  
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{i}\)</span> are the amplitude and phase, respectively,5 of each frequency <span class="math inline">\(f_{i}\)</span>= i/D (i = 1, 2, 3, . . .; the frequency interval is therefore <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f\)</span> = 1/D). With a Fourier analysis, we can determine the values of the amplitude and phase for each frequency and this would give us the amplitude and phase spectrum for this record (see Fig. <a href="index.html#fig:elevation">1.3</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:elevation"></span>
<img src="docs/fig3_4_amplitude%20and%20phase_waves_book.png" alt="The observed surface elevation and its amplitude and phase spectrum." width="462" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.3: The observed surface elevation and its amplitude and phase spectrum.
</p>
</div>
<p>If we were to repeat the experiment, i.e., measure the surface elevation again under statistically identical conditions (e.g., in an exact copy of the storm in which the first observation was made), the time record would be different and so would be the amplitude spectrum. To remove this sample character of the spectrum, we should repeat the experiment many times (M) and take the average over all these experiments, to find the average amplitude spectrum:</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:6">\[\begin{equation}
\overline{a}_{i}= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{m=1}^{M} a_{i,m} \text{ for all frequencies } f_{i}
\tag{1.6}  
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a_{i,m}\)</span> is the value of <span class="math inline">\(a_{i}\)</span> in the experiment with sequence number m. For large values of M the value of <span class="math inline">\(a_{i}\)</span> converges (approaches a constant value as we increase M), thus solving the sampling problem. However, it is more meaningful to distribute the variance of each wave component <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\overline{a}_{2}\)</span> (see Note 3A). There are two reasons for this. First, the variance is a more relevant (statistical) quantity than the amplitude. Second, the linear theory for surface gravity waves (see Chapter 5) shows that the energy of the waves is proportional to the variance.</p>
<p>The variance spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\overline{a_{i}^{2}}\)</span> is discrete, i.e., only the frequencies <span class="math inline">\(f_{i}= i/D\)</span> are present, whereas in fact all frequencies are present at sea. A first step to resolve this problem would be to distribute the variance <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\overline{a_{i}^{2}}\)</span> over the frequency interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f_{i}= i/D\)</span>, giving a variance density <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\overline{a_{i}^{2}}/\Delta f\)</span> at each frequency (i.e., it is constant within the frequency band <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f\)</span> ). All frequencies would thus be represented because they have all been assigned a variance density.</p>
<p>This is resolved by letting the frequency interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f\)</span> approach zero (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta f \to 0\)</span>). The definition of the variance density spectrum thus becomes</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:7">\[\begin{equation}
E(f)= \displaystyle \lim_{\Delta f \to 0}  \frac{1}{\Delta f}\frac{1}{2}\overline{a^{2}} \text{ or } E(f)= \displaystyle \lim_{\Delta f \to 0}  \frac{1}{\Delta f} E\{\frac{1}{2}\underline{a^{2}}\}
\tag{1.7}  
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>(in the formal definition, to be treated below, the average <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\overline{a^{2}}\)</span> will be replaced with the expected value <span class="math inline">\(E\{\frac{1}{2}\underline{a^{2}}\}\)</span> and the frequency band need not be the same for all frequencies). The underscore of a indicates that the amplitude will be treated as a random variable.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> <strong>The random-phase/amplitude model</strong><a href="index.html#the-random-phaseamplitude-model" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The basic model for describing the moving surface elevation η(t) is the randomphase/amplitude model, in which the surface elevation is considered to be the sum of a large number of harmonic waves, each with a constant amplitude and a phase randomly chosen for each realisation of the time record.</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:8">\[\begin{equation}
\underline{\eta}(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \underline{a}_{i}cos(2 \pi f_{i} t + \underline{\alpha}_{i})
\tag{1.8}  
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where N is a large number (of frequencies) and the underscores of amplitude a i and phase α i indicate that these are now random variables (see Fig. <a href="index.html#fig:harmonic">1.4</a>). The phases and amplitudes, being random variables, are fully characterised with their respective probability density functions. In this model, the phase at each frequency <span class="math inline">\(f_{i}\)</span> is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π (see Fig. <a href="index.html#fig:random-phase-amplitude-model">1.5</a>):</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:9">\[\begin{equation}
p(\alpha_{i}) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \text{  for } 0 &lt; \alpha_{i} \le 2\pi

<p>and the amplitude a i is at each frequency Rayleigh distributed (with only one parameter µi varying over the frequencies; see Fig.<a href="index.html#fig:random-phase-amplitude-model">1.5</a>):<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:10">\[\begin{equation}

\tag{1.10}  
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where µi is the expected value of the amplitude µi = <span class="math inline">\(E\{\underline{a}_{i}\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i}\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(E\{a_{i}\}\)</span> is the only parameter in Eq. (3.5.6), the statistical characteristics of a i are completely given by this one parameter (per frequency). The function that shows this mean amplitude along the frequency axis is called the amplitude spectrum <span class="math inline">\(E\{\underline{a}_{i}\}\)</span> (see Fig.<a href="index.html#fig:random-phase-amplitude-model">1.5</a>).</p>
<p>For a given amplitude spectrum, a realisation of <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\eta}(t)\)</span> can be created with Eq. <a href="index.html#eq:8">(1.8)</a> by drawing sample values of the amplitudes <span class="math inline">\(a_{i}\)</span> and phases <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{i}\)</span> from their respective probability density functions, at each frequency separately and independently.</p>

</div>
<p>Regarding the applicability of <strong>the random-phase/amplitude model</strong> to real ocean waves, the following remarks should be made.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, the random-phase/amplitude model generates a stationary (Gaussian) process. To use this approach for conditions at sea, which are never really stationary, a wave record needs to be divided into segments that are each deemed to be approximately stationary (a duration of 15–30 min is commonly used for wave records obtained at sea. In addition, at sea the wave components are not really independent from one another because they interact to some degree.

<p>The amplitude spectrum provides enough information to describe the sea-surface elevation realistically as a stationary, Gaussian process. However, it is more relevant to present the information in this spectrum in a different way: consider the variance <span class="math inline">\(E\{\frac{1}{2} \underline{a}^{2}_{i}\}\)</span> rather than the above-introduced expectation of the amplitude <span class="math inline">\(E\{a_{i}\}\)</span>. In other words, consider the variance spectrum instead of the amplitude spectrum (see Fig. <a href="index.html#fig:variance-density-spectrum">1.6</a> and Note 3A). Both the amplitude and the variance spectrum are based on discrete frequencies, whereas Nature does not select such discrete frequencies. All frequencies are present at sea. The random-phase/amplitude model needs therefore to be modified. This is done by distributing the variance <span class="math inline">\(E\{\frac{1}{2} \underline{a}^{2}_{i}\}\)</span> over the frequency interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f_{i}\)</span> frequency <span class="math inline">\(f_{i}\)</span>.

<p>The variance density spectrum was introduced in the previous section by transforming the discrete amplitude spectrum into a continuous distribution of the variance over frequencies. This spectrum shows how much <span class="math inline">\(\Delta var\)</span> a frequency band <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f\)</span> contributes to the total variance (see Fig. <a href="index.html#fig:interpretation-variance-density-spectrum">1.7</a>):</p>

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>It follows that the total variance <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\overline{η}}^{2}\)</span> (see Note 3A) of the sea-surface elevation is the sum of the variances of all frequency bands <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f\)</span> , or, for a continuous spectrum,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p>Note that, in a random wave field, the contribution of a single frequency to the total variance is infinitely small, because the spectral bandwidth of a single frequency is zero: <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f → 0\)</span> and its contribution <span class="math inline">\(\Delta var = E(f)\Delta f → 0\)</span>. However, the spectrum of one harmonic wave, i.e., a wave with only one frequency, contains a finite energy. Its spectrum therefore consists of a delta function at that frequency (infinitely narrow and infinitely high, with an integral equal to the variance of the harmonic wave, see Fig. <a href="index.html#fig:harmonic-waves">1.8</a>).</p>
<p><strong>The variance density spectrum E(f), showing how the variance of the sea-surface elevation is distributed over the frequencies, is rather difficult to conceive: a statistical characteristic (variance) is distributed over the frequencies of the harmonic components that make up the process.</strong> <strong><em>It may help if we multiply the spectrum by ρg. We then obtain the energy density spectrum (see below). This spectrum shows how the wave energy is distributed over the frequencies, which seems to be easier to comprehend.</em></strong></p>
<p>The overall appearance of the waves can be inferred from the shape of the spectrum: the narrower the spectrum, the more regular the waves are. This is shown for three different wave conditions in Fig. <a href="index.html#fig:harmonic-waves">1.8</a>.</p>
<p>Distributing the variance over a slightly wider frequency band gives a slowly modulating harmonic wave because the components involved differ only slightly in frequencies and therefore get out of phase with one another only slowly, thus creating a fairly regular wave field. Distributing the wave variance over a wider frequency band gives a rather chaotic wave field (irregular waves), because the components in the time record get out of phase with one another rather quickly.</p>

<p>As indicated above, the energy of the waves can be expressed in terms of the variance of the surface elevation because the energy of a harmonic wave (per unit horizontal ocean surface area) is equal to the mean-square elevation times the gravitational acceleration g and the density of water ρ, 5), so the total energy is</p>

<p>This close relationship leads to a rather inaccurate use of the word ‘<em>spectrum</em>’. It refers to both the variance density spectrum and the energy density spectrum. Very often, the two terms are used indiscriminately, with the context indicating which of the two is actually meant.

<p>The variance density spectrum can be defined in other ways than the one given above. The differences may relate to (a) the spectral domain or (b) the formal definition.</p>
<center>
<p><strong>The spectral domain</strong></p>
</center>
<p>The variance density has been defined in Section 3.5.4 above in terms of frequency f = 1/T (where T is the period of the harmonic wave), but it can equally well be formulated in terms of radian frequency ω = 2π/T . The corresponding spectrum E(ω) is then defined in the same manner as E(f); the only difference being that cos(2π ft + α) is replaced with cos(ωt + α). The total variance <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\overline{η}}^{2}\)</span> should be conserved in such transformations. In other words,</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:17">\[\begin{equation}
\underline{\overline{\eta}}^{2} = \int_{0}^{\infty} E(w)dw = \int_{0}^{\infty} E(f)df

<p>which is readily achieved by taking</p>

\tag{1.18}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:19">\[\begin{equation}
E(w) = E(f)\frac{df}{dw} = E(f)J
\tag{1.19}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where J = df/dω is called the Jacobian<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. In this case, that of transforming E(f) into E(ω), it has the value J = 1/(2π). <strong>Therefore, one must not only transform the frequencies f into ω, but also transform the density E( f ) into the density E(ω).</strong></p>
<center>
<p><strong>Formal definition</strong></p>
</center>
<p>The variance density spectrum has been defined above in terms of the randomphase/amplitude model. An alternative definition of the spectrum, which has exactly the same interpretation in the sense that it shows <strong>the distribution of the total variance over the frequencies, is based on the Fourier transform of the auto-covariance function of the sea-surface elevation:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:20">\[\begin{equation}
\widetilde E (f) = \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} C(\tau) cos(2 \pi f \tau)d\tau \text{ for } -\infty \le f \le \infty
\tag{1.20}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where the auto-covariance function C(τ ) is defined as the average product of the elevations at moments t and t + τ (each relative to its mean; see Appendix A). For a stationary process, the value of t is not relevant (by definition all statistical characteristics are then constant in time) and the auto-covariance function depends only on the time difference τ :</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:21">\[\begin{equation}
C(\tau) = E\{\underline{\eta}(t)\underline{\eta}(t+ \tau)\} \text{ for } E\{\underline{\eta}(t)\} = 0
\tag{1.21}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>For a stationary wave condition, both E˜ ( f ) and C(τ ) are even functions, i.e., E˜(− f ) = E˜( f ) and C(−τ ) = C(τ ). The variance density spectrum E( f ) is then defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:22">\[\begin{equation}
E(f) = 2\widetilde E(f) \text{ for } f \ge 0
\tag{1.22}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Since C(τ ) contains all covariances of the joint probability density functions of η(t) and η(t + τ ) for any t and τ , it provides a complete description of the process in a statistical sense (if the process is stationary and Gaussian and its mean is zero).</p>
<p>It has been noted in Section 3.5.3 (without proof) that the variance density spectrum, too, provides such a complete description. This statement is based on the fact that the Fourier transform is reversible, so that, from Eq. (3.5.16): C(τ ) = ∞ −∞ E˜( f ) cos(2π f τ )df . This reversibility implies that the one function can be expressed in terms of the other without loss of information. The variance density spectrum therefore contains the same information as the auto-covariance function and it describes a stationary, Gaussian process as completely as the auto-covariance function does. It also follows that the total variance is η2 = C(0) = ∞ −∞E˜( f )df = ∞ 0 E( f )df , which indicates that the spectrum E( f ) gives the distribution of the total variance over the frequencies.</p>
<p>This definition of the variance density spectrum, which is based on the auto-covariance function, is not used very often because the corresponding computations (first, of the auto-covariance function and then of its Fourier transform) are rather inefficient compared with the calculation of the amplitudes of Eq. (3.5.8) directly from a wave record (with a technique called the Fast Fourier Transform, FFT; see Appendix C).</p>

<p>To describe the actual, three-dimensional, moving waves, the horizontal dimension has to be added.

<p><strong>where the wave number k = 2π/L (where L is the wave length of the harmonic wave), kx = k cos θ, ky = k sin θ and θ is the direction of wave propagation</strong>.

<p>Adding two dimensions to the original one-dimensional random-phase/ amplitude model (dimensions x and y, added to time t, or, equivalently, wave number k and direction θ, added to frequency ω) would result in two more indices in the summation of Eq. (3.5.20). However, the index for wave number k is equal to the index for frequency ω because frequency and wave number are uniquely related (through the dispersion relationship of the linear theory for surface gravity waves; see Chapter 5: ω2 = gk tanh(kd), where d is the water depth). Every wave number k thus corresponds to one frequency ω and vice versa. The seemingly three-dimensional random-phase/amplitude model therefore reduces to a two-dimensional model in terms of frequency (or wave number) and direction. Each wave component is therefore indicated in Eq. (3.5.20) with only two indices: i (for the frequency or wave number) and j (for the direction). As in the one-dimensional model, every individual wave component in this two-dimensional model has a random amplitude a i,j (Rayleigh distributed) and a random phase α i,j (uniformly distributed). This two-dimensional random-phase/amplitude model represents a Gaussian process that is stationary in time and homogeneous in x, y-space: a spatial pattern of chaotically moving surface elevations, seen as the sum of many wave components propagating with various amplitudes, phases and frequencies (or wave lengths) in various directions across the ocean surface. The effect is a realistic representation of random, short-crested waves (see Fig. 3.10).</p>

<p><br>
The rationale of the definition of the one-dimensional wave-number spectrum is identical to that of the one-dimensional frequency spectrum except that time t is replaced with the horizontal co-ordinate x and that radian frequency ω is correspondingly replaced with wave number k. <strong>The one-dimensional variance density spectrum in terms of wave number, E(k), is then defined as</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:32">\[\begin{equation}
E(k) = \displaystyle \lim_{\Delta k \to 0} \frac{1}{\Delta k} E\{\frac{1}{2}\underline{a}^{2}\}

\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta k\)</span> is the wave-number bandwidth. Since frequencies <span class="math inline">\(ω\)</span> and wave numbers <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> are related through the dispersion relationship of the linear theory for surface gravity waves, the wave-number spectrum can be obtained from the frequency spectrum with</p>

E(k) = E(\omega) \frac{d \omega}{d k}
\tag{1.33}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where dω/dk is the Jacobian needed to transform from radian frequency to wavenumber domain (see Section 3.5.5; note that the value of this Jacobian happens to be equal to the velocity at which a group of waves propagates, cg = dω/dk; see Section 5.4.3), so that</p>

<p>All characteristics of this one-dimensional wave-number spectrum are identical or analogous to those of the frequency spectrum, e.g., <strong>the total wave variance is given by</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:35">\[\begin{equation}

<i>The two-dimensional wave-number spectrum</i>

<p>The harmonic wave components underlying the spectral description of the frozen sea surface, in two spatial dimensions x and y, can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:36">\[\begin{equation}
\eta(x,y) = a_{i,j}cos(k_{x,i}x + K_{y,j}y + \alpha_{i,j})

<p>and the corresponding two-dimensional wave-number spectrum E(kx , ky ) is defined,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> analogously to the above definitions of the various spectra, as</p>

<p>where J = k is the Jacobian used to transform the spectrum from the two-dimensional <span class="math inline">\(\vec k\)</span>-domain to the two-dimensional k, θ-domain (see footnote in Section 3.5.5). The two-dimensional frequency–direction spectrum E(ω, θ) is obtained from E(k, θ), simply with</p>

<b><i>The three-dimensional frequency–wave-number spectrum</i></b>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the previous sections, it was assumed that the dispersion relationship of the linear wave theory provides a unique relationship between the frequency ω and the wave number k. The spectra can thus be transformed from wave-number space to frequency space (and vice versa) and it allows the use of a two-dimensional rather than a three-dimensional spectrum to represent the moving, three-dimensional surface of ocean waves η(x, y, t). If the dispersion relationship is not assumed a priori (for instance to verify this relationship with observations), then these transformations cannot be made. The random sea surface should then be seen as the sum of a large number of propagating harmonic waves for which the frequencies and wave numbers are independent:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:43">\[\begin{equation}
\underline{\eta}(x,y,t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M}  \sum_{j=1}^{P} \underline{a}_{i,j,l} cos(w_{i}t - k_{j}x cos \theta_{l} - k_{j}y sin \theta_{l} + \underline{\alpha}_{i,j,l})
\tag{1.43}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>There are now three indices in this summation: the frequencies in this model have an index i that is different from the index of the wave number j. By using the same techniques as before, the three-dimensional variance density spectrum can now be defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:44">\[\begin{equation}
E(\omega, k, \theta) = \displaystyle \lim_{\Delta \omega \to 0} \lim_{\Delta k \to 0} \lim_{\Delta \theta \to 0}  \frac{1}{\Delta \omega \Delta k \Delta \theta}  E\{\frac{1}{2}\underline{a}^{2}\}
\tag{1.44}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>The alternative frequency–wave-number vector spectrum E(ω, kx , ky ) = E(ω, k ) can be transformed to this three-dimensional spectrum E(ω, k, θ) with the proper Jacobian (see above)</strong> because the relationship between wave-number k and direction θ on the one hand and wave-number vector k = (kx , ky ) on the other is retained (see Eq. 3.5.34). The definition of this spectrum E(ω, kx , ky ) is based on the same model as used to define E(ω, k, θ), with k j cos θl and k j sin θl replaced with kx,j and ky,l.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.8</span> <strong>Spectrum acquisition</strong><a href="index.html#spectrum-acquisition" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The techniques used to acquire the one- ortwo-dimensional spectrum are essentially the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>measure the sea-surface elevation with in situ or remote-sensing techniques and analyse the records (see Appendix C), or</li>
<li>predict the spectrum with numerical wave models using wind, tide and seabedtopography information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three-dimensional spectrum is hardly ever acquired since it would involve measuring the sea surface as a three-dimensional, moving surface (but it is sometimes done e.g., with a stereo- or radar-film. Operational spectral wave models always assume linear waves and predict the two-dimensional spectrum (usually E( f, θ)).In-situ measurements (e.g., with a heave buoy), followed by an appropriate spectral analysis can provide reasonable estimates of the one-dimensional frequency spectrum E ( f ) or E(ω). The mean direction and the directional spreading per frequency can also be determined if additionally some spatial characteristics of the waves are measured (e.g., with a pitch-and-roll buoy; see Section 6.3.4 for the concept of directional spreading). Remote-sensing and numerical wave models can estimate the full two-dimensional spectrum, usually the wave-number spectrum E(kx , ky ) (remote sensing) or E( f, θ) (wave models), from which the one-dimensional frequency spectrum E( f ) can readily be obtained.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> <strong>Transfer functions and response spectra</strong><a href="index.html#transfer-functions-and-response-spectra" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In Section (3.5.5), we considered the transformation of a wave spectrum from frequency f -space to the radian-frequency ω-space. This involved the simultaneous transformation of f to ω and of E( f ) to E(ω), using a Jacobian.</p>
<p>It is also possible to transform the spectrum of the surface elevation to the spectrum of some other wave variable, for instance, the wave-induced pressure in some point below the water surface. Such a transformation is not carried out with a Jacobian but with a transfer function. It requires that the relationship between the two variables can be treated as a linear system. The word ‘linear’ is crucial here. It means the following: consider a system that,</p>
<ul>
<li>on excitation with input x(t), responds with output X(t): x(t) → X(t) and</li>
<li>on excitation with input y(t), responds with output Y(t): y(t) → Y(t)</li>
</ul>
<p>then the system is called linear, if a linear combination of these excitations gives the corresponding linear combination of the responses:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:45">\[\begin{equation}
\boxed{ax(t) + by(t) \rightarrow aX(t) + bY(y)}
\tag{1.45}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>It shows that an amplification of the excitation gives an equal amplification of the response. It also shows that the responses to the excitations are independent: the response to excitation x(t) is not affected by the response to excitation y(t) and vice versa. The linear theory for surface gravity waves provides such a linear system. For instance, in this theory, the relationship between a sinusoidal wave surface elevation – the excitation x(t) – and the corresponding sinusoidal water pressure at some point in the water – the response X(t) – is a simple linear relationship in the above sense: if the amplitude of the wave is doubled, then the resulting pressure is doubled, independently of other excitations. One characteristic of a time-constant, linear system is that, when the excitation is harmonic, with a given frequency, the response too is harmonic, with the same frequency:<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:46">\[\begin{align}
x(t) = \hat x sin(2 \pi f t + \alpha_{x}) \rightarrow &amp; \boxed{\text{linear system constant in time}} \rightarrow X(t) = \hat X sin (2 \pi f t + \alpha_{X})
\tag{1.46}  
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The response X(t) = Xˆ sin(2π f t + αX ) differs from the excitation x(t) = xˆsin(2π f t + αx ) only in amplitude and phase. For a linear system therefore, the response can be described simply with the ratio of the amplitudes and the phase differences, which generally depend on the frequency of the excitation:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:47">\[\begin{equation}
\boxed{\hat R(f) = \frac{\hat X(f)}{\hat x(f)}\text{ amplitude response function}}
\tag{1.47}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:48">\[\begin{equation}
R_{\alpha}(f) = \alpha_{X}(f) - \alpha_{x}(f)  \text{ phase response function}
\tag{1.48}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The spectrum of the response EX( f ) is readily obtained as the product of the excitation spectrum Ex( f ) and the square of the amplitude response function Rˆ( f ) (the square is used because the spectral density is a measure of the square of the amplitude):</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:49">\[\begin{equation}
E_{X}(f) = [\hat R(f)]^{2} E_{x}(f)  \text{ response spectrum}
\tag{1.49}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The two functions Rˆ( f ) and Rα( f ) are called frequency response functions (they are the amplitude and phase response function, respectively). If the sea-surface elevation is stationary and Gaussian and the system is constant in time and linear, then the response too is stationary and Gaussian and as much characterised by its spectrum EX( f ) as the excitation is characterised by its spectrum Ex( f ). In the linear theory of surface gravity waves, the response functions are simple linear analytical relationships, so the above transformation technique can then be used to transform spectra of one wave characteristic into that of another, e.g., to transform the surface-elevation spectrum into the spectrum of the wave-induced pressure. If the response is direction-sensitive, two-dimensional response functions are required. For the amplitude this function is defined in the same way as the frequency amplitude response function:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:50">\[\begin{equation}
\boxed{\hat R(f, \theta) = \frac{\hat X(f, \theta)}{\hat x(f, \theta}\text{ amplitude response function}}
\tag{1.50}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where Rˆ( f, θ)is the two-dimensional frequency–direction amplitude response function. The amplitudes are the amplitude of the exciting harmonic wave xˆ( f, θ) and the response wave Xˆ( f, θ), respectively. The two-dimensional response spectrum is then readily calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:51">\[\begin{equation}
E_{X}(f, \theta) = [\hat R(f, \theta)]^{2} E_{x}(f, \theta)  
\tag{1.51}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This transformation seems obvious because it is totally analogous to the onedimensional situation above. The exciting harmonic wave, being an ocean wave, is readily seen as a wave with a direction of propagation. However, the response is often not a wave propagating with a certain direction or the response has only one, fixed direction. For instance, the wave-induced motion of the water particles normal to a pipeline on the sea floor (exerting the wave-induced force normal to that pipeline), has a fixed direction by definition. Nonetheless, the amplitude of such a response (non-directional or fixed-directional) can be defined. It is simply the amplitude of the response when the system is excited by an ocean wave from a certain direction (even if the response itself has no direction or a fixed direction). In such cases the computation is carried out in two phases. First, the above two-dimensional response spectrum EX( f, θ) is computed, and then the one-dimensional frequency response spectrum is calculated by integrating over all directions:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:52">\[\begin{equation}
E_{X}(f) = \int_{0}^{2 \pi} E_{X}(f, \theta)d \theta  
\tag{1.52}  
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The above introduction of response functions and response spectra has been given in the context of transforming the spectrum of the surface elevation into that of another wave variable. Such transformations are possible as long as the relationships involved are linear (in amplitude).
The notion of transforming the spectrum of the excitation to obtain the spectrum of the response is rather general; it applies to any linear system, for instance to compute stresses in or motions of structures in response to waves or wind. Here too, if the excitation is stationary and Gaussian, and the system is linear (which is generally true for small forces and motions) and constant in time, then the response (force or motion) too is stationary and Gaussian. One technique is to excite the structure with one frequency after another, and measure the amplitude and phase response for all these frequencies separately. Another technique is to excite the structure with random waves and to divide the response spectrum by the excitation spectrum.</p>
